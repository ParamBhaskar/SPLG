Overview:
This repository contains code for clustering individuals based on their interests using K-means and Complete Linkage Agglomerative (Bottom-Up) Clustering algorithms. The project aims to identify social clusters among people by grouping them based on their interests.

Summary:
The project involves several steps, including K-means clustering, evaluation of the clustering algorithm using the Silhouette coefficient metric, finding the optimal number of clusters, and implementing hierarchical clustering. The dataset used contains approximately 1000 instances with 12 features related to various interests such as Music, Movies, Politics, etc.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x

Dataset:
The dataset filename is "interests.csv", and it contains information about individuals' interests across different categories.

How to Run the Code:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Ensure that the "interests.csv" file is present in the project directory.

5. Run each cell of the python notebook (21CS30035_IMHC-AC.ipynb) by "SHIFT + ENTER". You can also run all cells at once.

6. Check the generated output files "kmeans.txt" and "agglomerative.txt" for the final cluster information.
